ESP32 is highly-integrated with in-built antenna switches, power amplifier, filters, and power management modules.ESP32 can perform as a complete standalone system or as a slave device to a host MCU, reducing communication stack overhead on the main application processor.ESP32 can interface with other systems to provide Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality through its SPI / SDIO or UART interfaces.

max30105
The SparkFun MAX30105 pluse oximeter Sensor is a flexible and powerful sensor enabling sensing of spo2 level and the blinking of an eye.

ECG
ECG is a method of collecting electrical signals generated by the heart muscle depolarizations.The AD8232 ECG sensor is a commercial board used to calculate the electrical movement of the human heart.

LM35
there are various temprature sensor in the market like lm35,tmp75,dht11,dht22 but in this project we use lm35 sensor to measure the temprature beacuse the accuracy of the lm35 sensor is very high and it is cheap in cost. it sense the temprature in the range of −55°C to 150°C.

Humidity sensor
HR202 is a new kind of humidity-sensitive resistor sensor, it can be used in many places like: hospitals, storage, workshop, textile industry, tobaccos, pharmaceutical field, meteorology, etc. feature of the this sensor are : 			
    Excellent linearity, low power consumption, quick response, anti-pollution, high stability

heart rate sensor
An optical heart rate sensor measures pulse waves, which are changes in the volume of a blood vessel that occur when the heart pumps blood. Pulse waves are detected by measuring the change in volume using an optical sensor and green LED.
