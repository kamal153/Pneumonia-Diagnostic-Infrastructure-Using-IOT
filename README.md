# Pneumonia-Diagnostic-Infrastructure-Using-IOT
Pneumonia has been labelled as the single largest cause of child mortalityfor the children under five in developing countries around the world. Wepropose a novel method to continuously monitor parameters likeRespiration Rate, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygenation (SpO2) and BodyTemperature in a non-invasive and non-obtrusive manner behind the ear.The data is streamed using Wi-Fi/BLE to the parent’s smartphone or asmart gateway device which uploads it to a server. This project alsoexplores the opportunities for presenting patient vital signs from such adevice to the remote health care workers and doctors. The device alsoenables doctors to track if medication is effective by seeing changes in thevarious physiological parameters. This will enable health workers in ruralareas that are extremely understaffed to assist more children. The devicewould also have alarm modes to alert parents to sudden onset of fever ordifficulty breathing.
